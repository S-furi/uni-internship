# Data Science With Kotlin
This repository contains a case study about the use of Kotlin for Data Science.
The internship consists of analyzing the powerful tools that **pandas**
provides and find their Kotlin counterparts.

The main focus was on three major python libraries:
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index)
- [`Xarray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)

As suggested in kotlin language [website](), the following libraries has been
analyzed:
- [`Dataframe`](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe)
- [`Multik`](https://github.com/Kotlin/multik)
- [`Lets-Plot`](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin)
- No libraries were found that accomplish what Xarray does.

## Tools For this project, as well as the above libraries, [Kotlin Jupyter Kernel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter)
were used for writing Kotlin code inside Jupyter notebooks, taking advantage of
Dataframe and Lets-Plot rich outputs. 

A list of instructions can be found in the [notebook instructions](./scripts/notebooks_instructions.md) file.
