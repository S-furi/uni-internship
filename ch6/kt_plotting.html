<p>In Lets-Plot, the main difference with python’s Matplotlib, is the creation of the plot by <strong>layers</strong>. In Kotlin, thanks to the possibility to overload the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> operator, we create the figure with a chain of additions on top of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Plot</span></code> object.
In the example below, we created</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The plot providing a series of points, and the mapping of map’s keys to plot axes.</p></li>
<li><p>The layer of the line.</p></li>
<li><p>A layer for the title</p></li>
<li><p>A layer for configuring the dimensions of the figure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach seems a little bit more expensive than with python:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">linspace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pi</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">plt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>but the benefits of layers can be seen in more complicated examples.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<h2>Lets-Plot Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#lets-plot-architecture" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As already said, a plot is composed by one or more <em>Layers</em>. Each layer is responsible for creating the objects painted on the “canvas” and each one contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>: the set of data specified for all layers, or one dataset per layer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aesthetic Mapping</strong>: describe how variables in the dataset are mapped to the visual properties of the layer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Geometric Object</strong>: a geometric object that represents a particular type of chart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Transformation</strong>: computes a statistical summary on the raw input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positional Adjustment</strong>: method used to compute the final coordinates of geometry.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="geometric-objects">
<h3>Geometric Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#geometric-objects" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>They are responsible for drawing in the plot. All the functions that are of the type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geomXxx()</span></code> create a new layer that draws the data. Every <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geom</span></code> object has its own default parameters and behavior, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.geom/index.html">documentation</a> for understanding what the desired plot does or require.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geom</span></code> package contains some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">statXxx()</span></code> methods which also create a plot layer: sometimes is more natural to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">statXxx()</span></code> objects instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geomXxx()</span></code> to add a new plot layer.</p>

<p>It’s possible to adjust the position of data, especially in all those cases where data overlaps.</p>

<h3>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The entire plot can be provided with additional <em>features layers</em>.
The features can be grouped in the following categories:;</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Scale</strong>: enables choosing a <a class="reference external" href="https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.scale/index.html"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scale</span></code></a> for each mapped variable, depending on its attributes. With scales, we can tweak things like, the axis labels, legends keys, aesthetics (like the fill color) and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coordinate System</strong>: determine how x and y aesthetics combine, to position elements in the plot. (i.e. for overriding default axes ratio we can use  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coordFixed(ratio</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2)</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legend</strong>: we can customize the legend (i.e. the number of columns) by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">guide</span></code> methods, or the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">guide</span></code> argument inside a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scale</span></code> method. The location of the legend can be tweaked with <a class="reference external" href="https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.themes/theme/index.html"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">theme</span></code>’s methods</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sampling</strong>: we can pick samples of the dataset (sampling is applied <em>after</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stat</span></code> transformations), and if the dataset exceeds a certain threshold, sampling is applied automatically (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">samplingNone</span></code> value disables any sampling for the given layer). See the <a class="reference external" href="https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.sampling/index.html"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sampling</span></code> documentation</a> for more.</p></li>
