    "The entire plot can be provided with additional *features layers*.\n",
    "The features can be grouped in the following categories:;\n",
    "- **Scale**: enables choosing a [`scale`](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.scale/index.html) for each mapped variable, depending on its attributes. With scales, we can tweak things like, the axis labels, legends keys, aesthetics (like the fill color) and so on.\n",
    "- **Coordinate System**: determine how x and y aesthetics combine, to position elements in the plot. (i.e. for overriding default axes ratio we can use  `coordFixed(ratio = 2)`).\n",
    "- **Legend**: we can customize the legend (i.e. the number of columns) by using the `guide` methods, or the `guide` argument inside a `scale` method. The location of the legend can be tweaked with [`theme`'s methods](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.themes/theme/index.html).\n",
    "- **Sampling**: we can pick samples of the dataset (sampling is applied *after* `stat` transformations), and if the dataset exceeds a certain threshold, sampling is applied automatically (the `samplingNone` value disables any sampling for the given layer). See the [`sampling` documentation](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/-lets--plot--kotlin/org.jetbrains.letsPlot.sampling/index.html) for more."
