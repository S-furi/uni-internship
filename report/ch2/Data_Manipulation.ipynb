    "When dealing with large datasets, having efficient tools and libraries can greatly improve the speed and accuracy of these tasks. In the following section, it will be presented **Kotlin DataFrame**, a library that is inspired largely by **pandas**, kotlin collections and Krangl. This library tries to integrate the dynamic nature of data, and the static typing of Kotlin, through a series of techniques that will be explored later on.\n",
